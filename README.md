# Snake-DeepLearning

Applying Deep Learning on Snake Game


# Installation

PyGame supports up to python3.7; therefore, this project will stay at Python3.7. Below guide are tested in MacOS 10.14.6 only.


1. Install Poetry

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3.7
```

You can find your python path (Virtualenv -> Path) by running below command `python3.7 ~/.poetry/bin/poetry env info`.

```
Virtualenv
Python:         3.7.4
Implementation: CPython
Path:           /Users/xxx/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/snake-deeplearning-LtzCkVy--py3.7
Valid:          True

System
Platform: darwin
OS:       posix
Python:   /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7
```

2. Install PyGame

Since PyGame is problematic for MacOS if you install it through regular approach, we need to comile it from source code. Below commands follow the guide from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59060598/2740386).

```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_gfx sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_net sdl2_ttf
git clone -b 1.9.6 https://github.com/pygame/pygame.git --single-branch
cd pygame
<Virtualenv python3.7 PATH>/bin/python3.7 setup.py -config -auto -sdl2
<Virtualenv python3.7 PATH>/bin/python3.7 setup.py install
cd ../
```

3. Install Project

```bash
python3.7 ~/.poetry/bin/poetry install
```

4. Run Game

```bash
python3.7 ~/.poetry/bin/poetry run game
```

# Cleanup

```bash
python3.7 ~/.poetry/bin/poetry env remove 3.7
```
